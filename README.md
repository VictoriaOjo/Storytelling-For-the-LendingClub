# Storytelling-For-the-LendingClub
This report will analyze Lending Club's underwriting processes, risk assessment models, and data sources to identify opportunities for improvement. 
It will leverage historical data, alternative data sources, and advanced analytics techniques like machine learning to enhance credit risk evaluation capabilities and increase accuracy in predicting loan defaults.
The report will also propose strategies to improve loan performance transparency for investors, such as interactive dashboards and clear communication of risk factors. The aim is to provide actionable recommendations to strengthen underwriting, refine risk models, mitigate fraud, reduce defaults, and foster trust among borrowers and investors.
